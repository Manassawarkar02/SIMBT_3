The Following Repository is about a Quiz app.
The <!doctype html> declaration specifies that the document is written in HTML5.

The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.

The lang="en" attribute in the <html> tag specifies the language of the document as English.

The <head> element contains metadata and other document-level settings.

Inside the <head> section, there are two <meta> tags:

<meta charset="utf-8"> specifies the character encoding of the document as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> sets the viewport properties for responsive design, ensuring that the page adapts to different device widths and initial scale.
The <link> tag is used to include an external CSS file named "Quiz.css" that contains styles for the quiz application.

The <title> element sets the title of the webpage, which will be displayed in the browser's title bar.

The <body> element contains the visible content of the webpage.

Inside the <body> section, there is a <div> element with the class "start-screen". This div contains a single <button> element with the id "start-button", which serves as the start button for the quiz.

Next, there is another <div> element with the id "display-container". This div holds the main content of the quiz, including the question, options, timer, and next button.

Inside the "display-container" div, there is a <div> element with the class "header". This div represents the header section of the quiz and contains two child elements:

<div> element with the class "number-of-count", which displays the current question number out of the total number of questions.
<div> element with the class "timer-div", which displays an image of a stopwatch and the remaining time for each question.
Inside the "display-container" div, there is another <div> element with the id "container". This div will be used to display the questions and options dynamically during the quiz.

After that, there is a <button> element with the id "next-button". This button allows the user to move to the next question when clicked.

Following the "display-container" div, there is a <div> element with the class "score-container hide". This div is initially hidden and will be shown at the end of the quiz to display the user's score. It contains a <div> element with the id "user-score" to display the score and a <button> element with the id "restart" to restart the quiz.

Finally, there is a <script> tag that includes an external JavaScript file named "App.js". This file likely contains the logic and functionality to handle the quiz, including generating questions, handling user interactions, and calculating the score.

In summary, the provided code sets up the basic structure and layout of a quiz application using HTML. The CSS file defines the styles for the quiz interface, and the JavaScript file (App.js) likely handles the dynamic behavior and functionality of the quiz.
